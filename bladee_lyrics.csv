Drain Gang forever
So, guess what?
What? I don't know
Take a knife and drain your life (Uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 1]
If it's a depot, gotta bite it (Bite, go)
If I see weed, I gotta light it (Uh, uh)
If I get feelings, gotta hide it (Gotta hide, uh, uh)
If it's illegal, I don't mind it (I don't mind, uh, uh)
I broke my wrist, I gotta ice it (Uh)
I wanna see you be my sidekick (Uh, uh, uh)
If I post pics, you gotta like it (Uh, uh, uh)
If you do this, then you're the nicest (Uh, uh)

[Chorus]
To be honest, if it's wrong, I don't want to be right
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
To be honest, if it's wrong, I don't want to be right
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
Talk to me nice, talk to me nice
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
Talk to me nice, talk to me nice
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice


[Verse 2]
Two strike is nothing, I three-strike it (Strike it)
Can't name the feeling, man, that I get (That I get)
All this shit, I'm goin' through a crisis (Through a crisis)
If you do this for me, you're the nicest (You're the nicest)
You're the nicest, my sleeve pull surprises
How many times I prayed? I pray three, I'm not anxious
Gotta play the game and it's free but not painless
I slide D&G, Silver Link, fuck a razor
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Be nice to me)

Can't you see it?
Bad dog, but for you I'm obedient
Trash Star, cross my heart, that's the reason
Look up at the stars, they're retreating
Don't get lost, don't live what I'm preaching
Drain Jesus, ice me immediately
Can't even come home when it's freezing
925, burn me my medallion

[Verse 1: Bladee]
Smell like spray paint, yeah, what I'm off of
Link at the gas stop, won't stop, I can't stop
Can't even see clear where I'm at though
This not a mansion, it's a castle
You a fuckboy, heard it from Ecco
Drain Show, no face, came through the back door
We can't even bring no girls in my section
Feel like OD9, I'm a dragon
Can't even talk to myself 'cause I'm wrong now
White gate calling me, won't be long now
I can't even put those words in my songs now
Big strong compounds, life force get crossed out
Siren calling, ambulance sound
Drain Gang track you down like a Bloodhound
I can't even trust myself when the night comes
Four doors, red or blue, pick the right one
It's some writing on the wall, it said ""Die scum""
No heart, but I do wish I had one
And my baby wanna know what I'm scared of
Don't worry, it's been taken care of
Bladee, I'm coming for the trash like a trashman
Hell Gang, put that back in the trash can
I can't even trust myself when the night comes
Step on my head twice like a cockroach


[Verse 2: Ecco2k]
Every time I close my eyes, I stop existing
Every now and again, I can tell the difference
Woke up falling, I'm still falling off of buildings
Want a new addiction, want to fall victim
Something you might crush my heart but I'ma risk it
And I'm still sinking, need a curse lifted
Blacklisted at all the clubs, but I can fix this
Think I need stitches, pray to three sixes
I wanna see heads roll, execute past life
Hundred white birds, ninety-nine fall out the sky
Fast life, race against time, it will outrun you
Rains return to the earth, sunlight to the underworld
Maybe in another life we could be lovers
Ever since we met, these thoughts keep getting worse
Iron will, ironed shirt, now I want a Fendi purse
I don't talk with empty words, what is any of it worth?
Every time I close my eyes, I go to prison
Every now and again, I can feel the distance
Woke up running, I'm still running through the system
Want a new sickness, want to fall victim
Somewhere, someone broke your heart but I'ma fix it
And I'm still wishing for that first kiss
Get blacklisted at all the clubs in Seven Sisters
Industry children play with three sixes

Every time I close my eyes, I stop existing"

You're my missing piece, will you keep my secrets?

Put a pill in a McFlurry, I'm goofy
Shoot me, acting for the cameras, it's a movie
I can see you're gloomy, 'cause I'm too T'd
I'm a dog on the roof like Snoopy
Sue me, hate me 'cause you're not me
I'm a white boy, 30 in my khakis
In the Uber and I sleep, fuck a car key
Love the smell of gasoline, bleach and sharpies
I was on Miami beach on a dark street
I wake up with sweaty sheets, sometimes it's deep
I'ma smoke a pound of weed if I can't sleep
If you can't sleep, you should call me
I'm in Stockholm for a week, I move discreet
Acting crazy off the coke, you can get beat
I make money off of songs, so it came free
So it goes free, put it on me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fight, nothing to talk about, walk it out
If you mad, don't wanna talk it out with you, Mickey Mouse
I'm inside the mansion, can't get out, get your feelings out
Gatekeeper, lock you out, Rainworld, we lock it down
MIA, I'm missing, can't be found, that's without a doubt
Do it for the money like a clown, watch me falling down
Swimming in the deep end, you might drown, I'ma bleed the crown
I can't feel the ground when I walk around


[Verse 2]
I'ma take a moment for my mind, we used to be tight
I go even deeper in the night, I'ma read my rights
I don't wanna open what you write, in another life
I get in my feelings like a knife, my heart bleeding out
I have tears inside and I don't even know how to cry
But it's giving me a drive, I just go on with my life
Tell me why you do me like you do, you don't need to lie
I'ma paint a smile, it's a disguise, I finesse you twice

High-five me, three-strike me, you like me? That's funny
I'm worried 'bout money, not about you, you're ugly
You're old news, that's dusty, I'm edgy, don't push me
I hang with some junkies, I'm shady, don't trust me

Who goes there? It's the ghost of October
Summer's over, now I'm goin' nowhere
Who holds her? It's not me, I'm a loner
But I don't wanna go-go-go there
You're sober, that's not me, I'm a stoner

But today I'm feelin' so indifferent
Every Friday's Halloween
My week is a dream, I'm just walkin' in my sleep
By any means, I'll be lowkey
I'm gonna need a reason to be seen
All the prayer is for nothing
No touching, I find it disgusting
Flyin' in my lane with my cousin
Why they bugging? I don't do discussion
I'm on an airplane to London
They want something from me all of a sudden
I'll come up when I'm summoned
I heard everything was gonna change but it worsened

Oh, how long have I been in this grave?
Inside asleep, but seemingly awake
It's not a nice way and I am ashamed

I'm under your spell and this is my cell

Off like ten pills, now I'm stillborn
Gotta stay pure just to make sure

In the ghost house with my people, it's the Shield Gang
I got all these shields and you can't breach them
On a plane, I'm switching seasons
Wait for God to give a reason to me
Daytime creeping, I can't fuck with human beings
I'm not sure what to believe in, I catch commas, not no feelings
You know Drain Gang, I got vampires in my city
Hit the party, take 'em with me, hit me up when I'm not busy
Feel like Casper, feel like you can't see me when I'm friendly
You can see me wearing Fendi as soon as I made my entry

This is what I really want, it is, I think (Mmm)
You think it mattered so much to me but it didn't (Nah)
One day I am here, the next I'm gone, extinct (Extinct)

Pure love only, baby
Always is, always was
Make and break me, baby
Is this all, is this all I want

Maybe I could be the one for you, I wish
I wish I could play the sport, I hit, I miss
But im coming back, of course you do, know this
I come out of the abyss but then I sink

Sink into the, into, into
Dark i fade, like love I fade away
One day I'm here, thе next I'm gone

I pray all night every day, I pray (Please God)
Was it all for nothing, nothing's all

Say you wanna have some fun, fuck it, I'm in
Might as well live in a cage you take my wings

Turn your mental prison into a maze
Turn the maze into a place where you're safe
Right now stepping on the graves even
Everything will wither and decay
But the energy will stay
Every day, early, late, every second even
Turn away for nothing, just in case
A sensation but it's strange
In a way everything is a secret even
Call myself a vessel, not a name
Call a taxi in the rain
Take a plane out of space to confess, I need it

[Chorus]
Endlessly reflecting in your gaze
Drop the mirror and it breaks
Seven years, seven tears, seven different heavens
Blue and black, I chase another shade
And I'm transcending the grey
To the rainbow in my brain, this array of color
Endlessly go over my mistakes
Just to find out what it takes
To be great, separate, differentiating
You hold on to me, the part that stays
Makes me grounded in a way, fly away
But today I'll go up, I know it


[Bridge]
I throw all my sympathies away
Pray my card will be a ace
Put my palm over my face
I can't stand to watch it
Everything is perfect in the void
I don't want it to be spoiled
I avoid it for so long, but I can't forever
(But I can't forever)

Endlessly reflecting in your gaze
Drop the mirror and it breaks
Seven years, seven tears, seven different heavens

Endlessly go over my mistakes
Just to find out what it takes
To be great, separate, differentiating
You hold on to me, the part that stays
Makes me grounded in a way, fly away

When I blow out the candles, the room turns black
When I look in the mirror, my face don't match
When I think 'bout you, baby, my eyes turn black
And I still think about you, I can't go back
Six bags amnesia to forget my past
Still trapped, nobody under my black mask
Skull cracked, no touching, I got glitter hands
Make a blood pact, me and you forever lasting
Make a wish for you, baby, the wish turns blue
K-9 in the airport, I look for you (For you)
When I look in the mirror, the light turns green (Light turns green)
'Cause you don't feel like me (Don't)

We sending controlled substances through customs

I know that love hurts but sometimes I wonder

Excel in everything, I ain't talking about an Excel sheet

The vibes are bad every time that we meet (Hah)
I cut my hand, like Jesus did, I bleed, I bleed, I bleed (I bleed)
I'm up so late (Late)

I still remember the first time I realized that nothing's finе
I'm still remembering thе rise, since then, it's been a big decline
How could these cowards take my kindness for a weakness?
(Thank God for every blessing)
I'm getting bored of all this stressing
Back to flexing and finessing
Hanging with peasants (NPCs) gets depressing, I'm repping Crest (Crest, crest)
The moon is crescent
I know it's not a competition but, shit, I'm winning, winning, winning
It's all I know
I know I'm falling off but, shit, I can't let go
I wipe my nose, it's all I know
Stumbling through the door and stumbling down
(There's something hidden in this riddle)
Between the lines, no, I'm just kidding
There's something cold about my vision
My fortune paints a ugly picture
If I should trust my intuition
I probably could do it different
To catch my drift, I'm going fishing
On my way back from going missing (Listen)
Should do the dishes in the kitchen (I'm back, ha)
But I am lacking the ambition
I let the neon diamonds glisten (Glisten, glisten)
I'm speaking codes so, baby, listen

Pink Floyd, the diamond is a prism (Prism)
Your threat towards us is nonexistent (Kill)
I'm in the hills, I'm pissing wishes
I give you everything, just listen (Listen)

I got a funny disposition
Bust down the cross but I'm not Christian
I'm talking shit, cold visions, is it? (Cold visions)

If you get hit then you get hit then-
I'm being rude like a Parisian
I keep it true like I got 'tism
I'm in the sewers on a mission
Something was true in my suspicions
There's something brewing in the distance (It's bad)
Without getting into specifics
Let's address a couple issues
I'm fresh to death, I'm dressing different (Hahaha)
I'm truly sculpted in His image
Try catch these things from my perspective
Without getting into specifics
My hoodie on, I look suspicious
Your hidden talents, keep it hidden
Don't wanna see you be a victim
Don't wanna wake up and remember (Haha)
The visions colder than December
DG the core we in the centre (Hahaha)
The blade be spinning like a blender (Bladee)
It's habit-forming, I'm dependent
No stainless steel in this here pendant (Don't look at me, stop talking to me, you know)
Tell them stop stealing my agenda
I'm pushing Drain Gang propaganda
High in the hills like I'm a Jenner (Beverly)
I'm him, did you assume my gender?
I'm HD clean, you need to render
The accountant told me, ""Stop the spending""

In an endless dark terrain
Through a tunnel under rain (Bladee)
There's a way that's not in vain
Through the sink and down the drain

Doing magic, David Blaine
Changing faces, changing name
Through the sadness and the pain
Hit the gas, accelerate (Skrrt!)
Get the journalist to sign an NDA about our process
Loss and gain and I have gained a lot of losses, like a hill covered in crosses
Tommy Hilfiger the boxers
Lacoste on us, shit don't cost us

Can I still wear my Balenci'?

Heavy rain falling forever on an everlasting flame
Heavy two-headed axe in a dirty duffel bag
Heavy hammers in the right hand, they can turn castles into sand
In the rain world, money system seeing how to scam the scam
On the stage going crazy, we're the new X Japan (C-C-C-C-Cold Visions)

The whole world full of serpents

Cut your face off like a surgeon
Off the grid, gone off detergents

I don't go out 'cause I'm nervous
I won't come back to this world, man
You wanna know what love is?
You wanna know what it feels like?
Wanted to see you in that light
Now I'm too deep in the night
I'm just ash now, I've been burning
When it's rain out, then I'm surfing
Know it's late now, but I'm learning
Everything calm on the surface

Ah
(Cold Visions)

[Verse 1: Bladee]
Hash from Norway, twice the price
Half alive and sleep deprived
Nothing works, but sleep don't hurt
Dirty life, baptized in dirt
In my soul, a growing hole
Void that spreads out of control
Panic, that became the norm
Out of fear, a child is born
Only calm once in the storm
Faith in stars I can't afford
Time pass by and brought me more
Yet, I'm weaker than before
Learned some more and lost some more
But I know less than before
And on stage, I am a—
And I hold my face to floor
Dance on the edge of the blade
To do a raid on the ravе
We burn some sage just in casе
Toxic waste to the face (Yes, sir)
We in V6s, no plates
We burnin' through the terrain
Fuck what it is, does it hit?
I got so rich off the spit
I post a pic, now you're pissed
I'll put your friends on the list
I'll pay your rent for the year
Take care of you when you're sick
I'll throw myself in a ditch (Ah)
I'll hurt myself if you wish
Crawling in the sewer with an axe on the side
Dark tinted windows on the whip, let's ride
Alligator shoes, everything reptile
Only I can talk about the night, it's mine (Working on dying)
Searching for destruction under blue street lights (F1LTHY, what's up, man? Been working on dying, man)
Hoodie on my head, sunglasses, dress shoes tied (It's crazy)
Seen so many friends that strayed from the light
Baby, is it fine?
But, shit, I'm still doing lines


[Bridge: Bladee]
It's bad even on a paradise island
I'm in hell in my mind even if I'm smiling
Just know that I'm fighting (Kill, kill, dumbass)

Just keep it on the low

I'm with the gang, throwin' up 4s, yellin', ""Shalom"" (Shalom)

Take 'em through the Swedish woods, they gon' know
Pop out with my gang through the trees like some creatures

Use a pocket, fuck a wallet

In Orlando, top, I drop it
Drop, I cop it, I should stop it
I won't make it, might Steve Jobs it
In the mall, tags popping
Blood is dripping on me, falling
Song recall it, now it's never dropping
Treat you like my brother, or my cousin, but you're undercover
Treat it like it's nothing, 'cause it wasn't, and it really wasn't
Might sleep in a coffin, but I wake up, might be drinking coffee
Get these people off me, get you off me, leave it like a crime scene
You might find a copy, but there's no one that can do it like me
Do it like me, do it like me
Misery loves company, so you should come hang with me
So come and hang with me, you should come hang with me

If you believe in luck

Complete annihilation of us
Walk in light, see with anothеr eye

Had to make it worse, even more so
So, when I'm at my lowest, there's no other way
I'd only go up, I hope it's so
Fear of death and stress causes stress and fear of death
I can't lie, I must confess
Fear of death and stress causes stress and fear of death

I'm praying to God, please god may you bless me (Please God)
Still the same me but, baby, lately I've been messy
I must forgive myself before you can even forgive me
The shell is pretty, the Devil's busy
Oh, looks desperately for a sign, it's trials and tribulation time
The brave attempt fails and falls flat, he tries to take everything back
He's sure that something will go wrong, and that makes everything go wrong
But still the hope it's strong (The road is long you must go on)

Hit you with a forehand, I been laying dormant

Why would you wanna go home with the DJ
When you can stay out with the real Bladee?
Snake blood all in my cup, but I bleed gray
Wanna do me sideways but I see straight
Ecco pull up in LA in a i8
I get the bag, they drop off for me, Postmates
See you rolling off some pills, baby, hydrate
At the Hyatt, smoking drain, had to violate
Put Drano in my glass for the headache
Can't hide it anymore so I escape
Tell Nino bring an eighth of the high grade
Upgraded on them quick, give me migraine
Rainworld, the CEO, give me mild rain
Frosty, I'm drinking ice, give me ice brain
Brain freeze, I'm in the east by the palm trees
Drain team, I sip that bleach for a blood leech
Drain team, I sip that bleach for a blood leech
No cut for you, I cut out my trustees
Walk in Prada, treat that shit like it's Nike
You hate on me, got two letters, I C

(Whatever)

[Chorus]
Came back again from extraordinary lengths
Just to justify the ends
No more pressure to pretend
To be less than what I am
And the story starts again
And the truth comes back in trend
I'm not holier-than-thou (I'm really not)
But we're trendier than them (Haha)

[Verse 1]
Kill a part of you that's not true to the heart of you
Pull a joker card on you, I didn't mean to startle you
I pulled off, it was not enough, I left a scar on you
I guess that game wasn't hard enough, sorry to bother you
This drain life, it will harden you, might make a martyr out of you (Haha)
I might walk a lonely road, but I walk the road I choose
The fame and the glory is what came from the pleasures and the pain
(Memories will never fade and the traumas will remain)

[Bridge]
I want innocence, Snow White
Want innocence
I want innocence, Snow White
The way she shines her light
You'll always be by my side
And I'll walk forward with pride
And as legends never die
Live forever through the times
Gold cross means you crossed my mind
Blind in faith and love I'm blind (I'm blind)


[Verse 2]
I'm three steps ahead of you, to put you on a pedestal
I never knew a thing but I knew when I was ready to, to learn
How to walk the golden curve and to be where we deserve
To be far away from hurt, place the nine above the world

Me and Adamn gettin' commas like it's nothin'
Fallin' in the club off a pill and Robitussin
Send your girl emojis, now she's blushin'
If I send her real words, so now she's crushin'

He say he's a friend but I don't trust him

If you see us, know we world stars from afar

When you talk to me, lil' bitch, like I'm a Sergeant
You think that is your bitch, but that bitch she thottin'
I can't save no thot, because I'm money plottin'
I don't answer doors, unless the money knockin'

We be flexin', broke niggas think we is not them

Smoking on the pollution, all black suit
Black gloves on, just like a hitman

Wake up, drinking coffee
I get to it often, might get to it this morning
Prada boots on, look like some Jordans
I'm playing, I'm scoring

Just do it, blade on me, I'm swording
I'm veiled when I'm wielding
Knife in my heart but, man, fuck how I'm feeling
Can't look at me, you're dreaming
Can't even see me when you are sleeping
Black Volvo, we're creeping

[Chorus]
I had ups and downs but it's falling into place
Like the love from God when you look me in my face
I had dreams of life that were lost in empty space
I had almost drowned if I didn't fuck with that drain
I had four, five strikes, at the sixth I lost my wings
I'm the puppeteer, put my puppets into play

Need no reason to, I just do whatever I like

[Chorus]
Been around, still around the finish line
Background check them 'fore they come around
Drain Gang tree house and you're not allowed
Dead tree branches and they hanging down
I smell the money, gotta hunt it down
Still talking 'bout me, you gotta cut it out
They're moving sideways but it's going south
You remind me of someone that I forgot about
It's getting crazy in the haunted house
I might pop out and sleep on the couch
Used to have demons but we're homies now
Used to be on some shit but it's over now

You've been tryna run into me on my coldest night
I can't go if it's not feeling right
And I'm in the dark tunnel but I see a light
It's a hard day, I might get an upgrade
I get the stop made even when I'm up late
Been a long way, it really came a long way
Might get a heartbreak swimming in the dark lake
They call me Boss BladeeCity where the sword lays
I've seen a late night turn into a morning
I know you hate me but it's not important
I know 'bout death 'cause it's waiting at my doorstep
This is not fake so you can't afford it
I can't have fans 'round 'cause they wanna record me
I'm in your city, that's another story
I fuck my real life up 'cause that shit bore me
I'm in some Air Force, can't do Michael Jordan's
I know you hate me, I'm working when you're snoring
And I've been global so there's nothing foreign
They know my name, I am buddies with the doorman

‘'Fake News’‘ as a term has… Read More [Chorus]
You make me feel so blue
I know I'm not perfect, but what about you?
I know I do wrong, but I know you do too
But I feel so worthless standing next to you
You wanna buy verses, but I can't sell you
I'm talking to myself, it's enough to hate you
I wanna get up but I'm coming down soon
Put me on my back, bring me down like a flu

[Verse]
I'm walking until my heels bleed, tryna find you
They tell me I shouldn't worry but it's fake news
You're acting so cold to me but it burns too
I am not myself so don't take it personal
Something like twenty thousand, what we burn through
Prada walking backwards, two times I curse you
Prada walking backwards, two times I curse you
I am not myself so don't take it personal
Prada walking, dirty dancing
I don't know if she flirting when she says I'm handsome
I am not myself, I'm just acting
I can feel the static, good dog catch the rabbit
Money, I'm an addict, ghost in the attic
Trashman, I manage to trash, I say trash it
Black leather jacket, I need that, the package
They want it, my precious, it's cut like my ex's
On the stretchers, bed boy, I'm bedded
Good night, I'm resting, search the alley
Smoke rolling in, I'ma let it, fuck it
Crabs in a bucket, my fee, I'ma up it


[Chorus]
You make me feel so blue
I know I'm not perfect, but what about you?
I know I do wrong, but I know you do too
But I feel so worthless, standing next to you

I'm talking to myself, it's enough to hate you
I wanna get up but I'm coming down soon
Put me on my back, bring me down like a flu"

Even if it's God's will, I just can't chill (I just can't chill)
I try to be normal, I'm too ill (Sick)
It hurts to stay in my skin, real spill (It's true, bro)
Two crosses, both bleed from the world's greed (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Diesel truck mounted up, SG shield (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Read the creed of this weed, please excuse me (Hey, hey)
Maybe I'm what you wanna be (Hey, hey, hey)
Maybe you're not as fine as me
I gained weight and lost hair off this damn stress (Yes)
Man, fuck being deprеssed, asbestos (Oh)

Red light moments, we going, still going

Fast forward, who are they? I don't know 'em
Sit on the throne and it's frozen (Sit on the throne and it's frozen, my energy, my everything)

Coke up in my socks, ten years later, still can't care enough (Ayy, ayy, BladeeCity)

Don't care what you got, put this weight to our names like we're jocks

Take you off the radar
Thaiboy, that's my name
I get my foreign from the bay
Me and my homies on the way
We do this everyday
SG, that's my way
Shouts out to all my mistakes
Never seen these Apes
Now I'm feeling well, I'm 'bout to flex the whole day
Flex it, made it made, flex it, made a million
When I'm running 'round in the Stockholm with the drain
People trying to say
They don't know what's up, try and take you far away, away
I could have graduated from Yale
But young Thaiboy chose the fame, fame
Ayy

"35 ContributorsLike a Virgin Lyrics[Intro]
First time, first time like a virgin
I'm a fiend for the drugs, who is serving?
They want to be me like they're Kirby
But I'm too advanced, it's not working
I come from the rain, are you thirsty?
I'm in love with pain, someone cursed me

[Verse 1]
Take a chance with me, is it worth it?
I'm gonna stay up 'til it's not even that early
Every time I get a chance, it gets out of hand
Burning through the grams to the point where it gets sad
I'm still in the land where nobody understand
But I'm with the gang, and they know that it gets bad
Fucked it up again when I'm fucked up off a Xan
What the fuck is happening tonight? What's the plan?
They don't wanna see me make it to the top
But I'm feeling like I'm being watched
Everywhere I go, I'm staying locked
But I got the key on me, it's hot
I don't wanna go out 'til it's dark
I've been goin', goin' to the stars
They don't wanna see me getting guap
But I'm getting money, I can't stop

Draining in the haunted house and there is no boys allowed

Find out what I dream about, come out when them fiends are out
Two bros and three hang arounds, I don't hang around with clowns
Kill the light and eat the night, now I'm not so dead inside

Life was okay but I need what is after
After you like a tracker, you backstabber
Alice in Wonderland and I walk backwards
Ghost like I'm Casper, we wait for no answers
Life was okay but I need what is after
Weed on the dresser, feel like a jester
Leave on a stretcher, don't need to be special
Thinking about you, it takes me right back
You showed me if I was on the right track
Credit on the card, we gonna swipe that
If they say strike it, we gon' strike that

I'm shining bright, I'm like a strobe
They're watching me like some drones
I cannot lie
Don't call my phone, leave me alone
Rain on my phone
I cannot lie
I dream of life, it might come true, but now it depends on you
I know you know

[Chorus]
If there's love in your heart, I'll find it
Can't see me in the snow, I'm blinded
If you see me on the street, don't mind it
Off the trashpack, that's my diet
Let's go, I'm gone like lightning
Peaceful but my bro real violent
I'm a psycho but I know how to hide it
In the night but I'm not tired"

We at the top floor of the Hilton with little to no feelings
Hoodie on, I'm a civillian, Oakleys on like a Brazillian
No gravity in the building, we all up in the ceiling (I'm lost)
Chandelier on my wrist, it's evident we mean business
In the mall swiping cards
Decisions, decisions
Crocodile Dundee, alligator skin all over me
I'm having superiority, get all your sin away from me (Elite, drain)
I've had enough, this shit boring me
It's time for another story
I've been feeling immortal
I straight drop paranoia
Backpack on like I'm Dora
I start feeling important (Started)
I started moving major, I'm in immediate danger
So cold, our reality is blueberry flavoured
It's 9 PM in the morning, I'm on the court scoring

That boy was never into sports
I carried the Olympic torch
Please don't get too close, you might get scorched
White Havaianas and some shorts
They think I'm stealin' in this store
I'm winnin' dirty boy awards
All white, it's Snow White, seven dwarves
Lucky Luke, came out winning wars
Did this ten years, how many more?
When I retire, burn the corpse
Am I the freshest? Yes, of course
But it'll never be like before
Don't even know what I want anymore
Life has the chance through any storm
The money never made me happy, but it never made me sad
This shit had never made a difference, but, shit, I carry the flag
They tried to trick me, man, it's tricky when you collectin' heavy bag
I had to kill a couple millions in they face, it make me laugh

I had to kill a couple mil' just to kick back here and chill
And while I'm rollin' up this blunt, I'ma tell you how I feel

Young Thaiboy, I don't read no book, I pull up the bank and go to the moon
It be blood, sweat, and tears on the way
But I got the eyes on the prize anyway
So no need to roll the dice anymore
To me, it's some kind of a life anyway
So I hop in and roll, on go with the rack
Thirty for a show, I spend it right back
I feel like Montana, I'm shipping the bag
I feel like Jeff Bezos when I'm in the bank

Try to take my swag, I will try to take your life
If you fuck around with Bladee, I will turn into a knife
I see your secrets, I am on you like the wind
There's too much evil, I let everything begin
Suicide doors, Lamborghini, Porsche, no skateboard
We don't play war, no fake swords
I got seal sewers, put them to your sword
Make you feel the real force
I got no remorse, driving foreign vehicles
Pink walls, waterguns, drink those
I turn your whole life to a sinkhole
Fold up clothes, got new clothes
No new friends in my new phone

Fumbling in the dark, I'm going blind
Tryna figure out where I lost my little mind
Falling through the circles in the sky
Falling from the heart
Sword is getting drawn
Destiny prefers a certain type
Luck is very shy, tends to hide and she's not always not and it's not always nice
And the price if you try in the end in this game we all die
There's not that much left for me, bleed to be less lonely
Just one breath is bliss for me, please my death come slowly
Feeling really, really, really weak
I'm trying to flee it but I see you when I sleep
Honesty come creeping like a thief
No one wanna hear the screams, no one else but me
For what? I was chasing something for that one thing I forgot
Was it that important? Maybe not
Can't you see I bleed? Baby, can't you see?

I have always felt a few steps outside of myself
A few seconds too late
Knowing but unable to formulate
Too vain, too lame
To aim, to chase
Having but unable to have
Collecting the sand
To try and restore the stone
The vision is clear
But I'm nowhere near
Carrying something that's too heavy to bear
But wanting it near
And holding it dear
Is it out of fear?
Cold Visions

[Verse]
Cold winter flowers under snow, is it still living? (In the snow)
Cold vision (So, so, so cold)
Yes, yes, all alone (It's so, so cold)
Summer's indefinitely postponed
I hope, I'll hope
I hope I won't be buried under this snow
All this snow, so cold, so cold (So cold)
Not knowing where to go
Flowers lying down dormant for long
Torment that has made them strong
Spring comes, they'll grow
They know (They, they know)
Feather in the wind sinks like a stone
When the wind's finally gone
But the place is not the point
Two sides of the same coin
I don't care but I care
When challenged by nothing
I'm asking for suffering (Suffering)
I'm asking for it
I don't care but I care
What is this sick justice?
Our flesh turn to plastic (Suffering)
The rest is history

Yellow leaves in a black puddle
Smell of the winter soon coming

I'm scared of nothing
I want something
Say something
Just tell me something
Anything
I know I said I'd do anything
And you never thought I would lie
Neither did I
Let's wish for something
Let's skip assumptions
Let's think, let's sing
Won't you let the love in?
Let's wish for something

Still feel your presence even, even, even whеn no one, no one, no one's around

It's more than enough for me to be immortalized
Still feel your presence even, even, even when no one, no one, no one's around

Over and over and over again
Too many times in a row, the same lesson I know

Golden, golden, golden
Too many fights in a row, there's no shame to let go

Hide my face, need my praise
Leave this place, lead my way

It could have been a lot of stuff but it just wasn't us
The very thought of how you operate, I'm filled up with disgust
I live and die for the cause, nail me to the cross
Take your pity off, maybe listen up (Let go)

The easiest route is the one that I choose (Haha)
'Cause it feels like the only one working (Winter in my mind)
This isn't the truth and I know
Yet I choose the way that makes me lose (Hehe)
And that hurts me the most (Lonely)
I told my bro, ""You gotta stop""
And he told me, ""But for what?""
Man, I don't know
Having issues with the drugs
Man, it really isn't fun
Man, this shit will have you dumb
Have you seriously fucked up
Make your reality pale
Feel like every ship has sailed
Feel like everything is too late
Feel like nothing is okay
Feel like there isn't any way (You're listening to a Ripsquad exclusive)
Feel hate as soon as you awake
Each day is ruined every day
Might as well do it anyway
Might as well go through it anyway
'Cause you can't see another way
But there must be another way
But you're too caught up in the shame
But there must be another way
But you must have a higher aim
You should forgive yourself again
And walk the way that you create
And walk away from all this pain
Don't be addicted to the pain
There is a way that you can take
But it's a way you'll have to paint
The way is one you have to make
'Cause only you can break the chains
And even if it feels so hopeless
It's never too late or over
There's always a way from nowhere
Only up, we can't go lower
Only up now, can't get lower

I have sunlight on me like earth
I'm tryin' to get clean, wash away the dirt
I want to hold you so bad right now
I bought a pack of the eggplant loud
If you go up against me, you'll go down
If you go up against me, you'll go down

All that I want is to enter the light
After I die, I wake up and I rise

I'll be schemin' and leanin', ya'll try to be seen
But, when I'm all alone, I'm real sad in the evening
Counting money like a preacher

You don't like humans? Me neither

I bring myself down if I see her
I look down when I meet her

Thank you
Two step backwards out when I walk
Three steps back wishing on a star
Four step down wishing on a star
Three stars, but six points on the star
Things that look pretty from afar
Too good to be without a flaw
Drew once again the shortest straw
To be the law, you break the law
I saw a rainbow in the dark
I put a symbol in a song
I put a window in the wall
To the statues in my mind, stand forever

Stand so, so serene
Silver statues in my dream

Chaos follows dreams to fulfill this fantasy
Fly my swallows, swear to the one your loyalty
No tomorrow, nothing is promised as you see
Face these horrors, don't break under the weight, carry

[Verse 1: Ecco2k]
Don't stop following the North Star
Talking to the walls, I told them keep walking
Overground, running in between, cars flip over on me
Dive like a dolphin
Be honest, I'm cut down like the forest (Uh)
Toxic like the ocean and I'm dirty like the soil
Black tar and oils, I'm acid on the corals
Crushed into the fossils in the ground under heavy forces

Will I allow the low? No, no, no
But I'll allow the gold to grow and show the way to know
Will I go on my own? Say it ain't so
But I would if I have to do for you, for you, for you

No photos, they look at me like tourists
Everywhere I go is saturated with these voices
It's poison, I try to stay platonic
Counting every face, every day, with the sixth solid

I lost everything, I'm trying to be glad I had it

Shit been getting hard to manage
But I'ma be stuck in glory like rush hour's traffic
Burning out rapid like matches
Each piece of clothing matches
In these places I imagined
In the darkness beyond sadness
In a purple coloured mansion
In a ring we spin like Saturn
Phantom tryna catch the dragon
I'm the king of nothing matters
In this castle that's abandoned (Drain)
My body rotten, it's the price of being modern
Who said what 'bout me? Go call 'em

One day gone but not forgotten
One day gracefully departing (Only one)

They will act like we were buddies

Tryna switch the concentration
Just let go, be like water (Express what you are)

Towards light through this tunnel

In the most isolated part of my being is where I will find everything

Dark shades in the middle of the night
I'm high, I'm high, I'm high, I'm high
Standing in the rain, it's like she shines
Glittering, she spins around, around, around
The city's evil lights, like evil eyes
Like ice, I'm cold, I'm cold, I'm cold (I'm cold, I froze)
And it's like it demands life, it demands life
To die, to die, to die tonight
To die tonight, a sacrifice
A sanctioned kill
The buildings commit, it slits your wrist, you cease to exist
You feel nothing, you feel nothing, you feel nothing
The curtains are ripped, the cranium split, and in the blood spill
A temple is built, a tower of guilt, a tower of sin
[Bridge]
Destruction, desolation
Desperation, despair
Delusion, deprivation
Disappearance of air
Destination nowhere

Make monuments that hold, excellent things we make
Excellent will displayed, ask gold or go ask jade

You play like US Open (Bitch)

I fucked a ho in the ocean (Like that?)

Can't keep it back, I keep it goin'
And, girl, I know you kick the door in (Bitch)

Got her going, keep 'em callin'

It's all fair, all fair
In the words, in the scriptures, in my life, it's all there
I smile, I don't care, don't care
Left my mind and disappear
Skull crush, skull crush, leave you there
Pull up and change the clouds
Colours, they painted out
Life is not black and white
Nothing is ever right
So I can't go without a fight
Same friends around, I keep it tight
Dark in my mind so I chase the sunlight

[Verse 2: Ant Wan]
You can get lost in my pain
Take your clothes off, entertain
Fuck your side bitch and your main
On sunny days we make it rain
Put some respect on my name
I keep a gun on me daily
Don't try to come back to me, baby
Aftеr all I've seen of course I ain't crazy
I'm one of a kind, I see no lovе, I think that I'm blind

[Verse 3: Bladee]
Life's a playground, let me play
DNA, diamonds shining, never fade
X you out, SG life, vipers strike you out of spite
Seraphim come down
Cherubim come down
Extra light
Diamonds, diamonds are forever, never die


[Verse 4: Yung Lean]
Everybody seems to think that I'm crazy
I don't mind, waste my time
Oxy oxy, lemon-lime, I don't mind, chase the sky
Everybody wants to be amazing
Flaws I find, In the dirt I shine
Let, let, now let it shine
The summer's mine

[Verse 5: Ant Wan]
I'm so high (High)
Mama, they hate that I made it
We love like love in the 80's
But she left like ""What?"" and I hate it
I still don't know how, baby why?
Killers beside me
Diamonds dancing on my neck, got cops behind me
Pussy boy, you ain't a threat
Twenty bullets in your head
I'm always working, I don't get no rest
I can't get it right, too many left
Twenty bullets leave you dead

[Verse 6: Bladee]
Royalty success
It's time to go crazy, thousand stars
Endless sunshine on me
Starlight on my arms
Stars on stars
Royal kingdom, one million on my name
You stay true
Dreaming, dreaming in a dream, I take your queen
Make you queen, I'll make you queen


[Verse 7: Yung Lean]
A milli on my neck
Die for my respect
Diamonds cut the check, aye
I die for my respect
Milli on my name
I don't give a fuck about the fame
All I see is fake love and true blood
Fake love and true blood

On top of the game

I'm on a line, I cross over (Okay)
Up to the clouds, we can go there
Walking with the faith
Venom in the vile
Hold on to the crown
Caught up in a maze
Spider in the web
Everything is grace

I can bleach the darkness out your mind
White powder, white pills, leave your body behind
Sub-zero ice camouflage, leave you snow blind

We the future of the frozen city, dressed in bright white
Coming for the cold winter, stay for the nightlife
If you don't dress right, you ain't my type

Yeah, yeah
Okay, okay
Thaiboy, Thaiboy

[Chorus: Thaiboy Digital]
I'm lost, I'm lost
I'm lost, I'm high
I'm lost, I'm lost
I'm lost, I'm high
I'm lost, I'm lost
I'm lost, I'm high
I'm lost, I'm lost
I'm lost, I'm high

[Verse: Bladee]
Give up all hope, I can finally start living
I'm a robot, I let the drugs give me feelings
When I'm too drunk, I can't talk with my feelings
I don't talk to girls, they only talk 'bout their feelings
No gravity because my boys in the building
They didn't let me in, so I climb to the ceiling
A knife in your face will make you pray to religion
When the money's gone, I have to pray for a million
I'm poor


[Chorus: Thaiboy Digital]
I'm lost, I'm lost
I'm lost, I'm high
I'm lost, I'm lost
I'm lost, I'm high
I'm lost, I'm lost
I'm lost, I'm high
I'm lost, I'm lost
I'm lost, I'm high"
"1 ContributorOXYGEN (No Autotune) Lyrics[Verse]
Burn down trees like a forest ranger
Getting close to nature
I'm a fallen angel
Keep a lightsaber
Keep your enemies close, I decapitate them
I feel like Iron Man
I got the iron maiden
I tried to understand but it was hopeless
I tried to eat her soul but she was soulless
So cold, so cold
I don't need air
I don't need oxygen
I'm over everything
I don't need air
I don't need oxygen
I'm over everything

[Outro]
So cold, so cold
So cold, so cold
So cold, so cold
So cold, so cold
Hell yeah, I love my squad"
